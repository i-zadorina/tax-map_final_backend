# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features
- MongoDB 
- Mongoose 
- Express project
- RestAPI
- using nodemon to hot reload
- using ESLint as linter
- using Prettier to format code
- using Postman for testing
- using GitHub Actions for checking code
