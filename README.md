# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.
Front-end repo: [https://github.com/i-zadorina/se_project_react]

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Features

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express project
- RestAPI
- using nodemon to hot reload
- using ESLint as linter
- using Prettier to format code
- using Postman for testing
- using GitHub Actions for checking code
